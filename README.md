# Conquer

## New name is needed!

Conquer is a single player round-based strategy game. Can you conquer the entire world?
Play Conquer to test your strategic abilities and see how creative you can get thanks to the extensible and open architecture.

This is a reimplementation of my game [Conquer](https://github.com/JCWasmx86/Conquer) in Vala for the GNOME desktop.

Furthermore it is an attempt to write a non-trivial game only following the GNOME HIG as far as possible and
as far as it makes sense.
