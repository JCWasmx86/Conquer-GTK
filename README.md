# Conquer

Conquer is a round-based strategy game. Conquer all the cities on the map.

This is a reimplementation of my game [Conquer](https://github.com/JCWasmx86/Conquer) in Vala for the GNOME desktop.

Furthermore it is an attempt to write a non-trivial game only following the GNOME HIG as far as possible and
as far as it makes sense.
